# OCamlMonopoly

Welcome to OCamlMonopoly, a satirical twist on the classic Monopoly game! This project was developed as my final project for CS 3110: Data Structures and Functional Programming at Cornell University.

## Project Overview

My aim was to create a fun and entertaining game that captures the essence of Cornell University within the Monopoly framework. From iconic campus landmarks to witty references, this Cornell-themed version offers a delightful twist for players familiar with the university.

## Features
* Engaging gameplay that mirrors the mechanics of the original Monopoly game.
* Customized game board featuring Cornell-specific locations, showcasing the rich heritage and culture of the university.
* Unique and witty event cards and chance cards, incorporating inside jokes and references that Cornellians can appreciate.
* Implementation in OCaml, a powerful functional programming language, to demonstrate our proficiency in CS 3110 concepts.
* Thoughtful design and user experience considerations to ensure an enjoyable and immersive gaming experience.
